                <p>Hey what's up? I'm Chuck, welcome to my bio page, or as I will now affectionately refer to it, <strong><em>The Sideline Story</em></strong>. I'm a junior Information Sciences major with a concentration in Web Development. Imagine Wade from Kim Possible, but I actually go outside. When I'm not in front of a screen, I'm probably working out, playing football or basketball, or riding my longboard somewhere. I also play video games <span style='color: blue'>(PSN - Chuck_O_Beast)</span> and yes I do watch anime. Yeah yeah I know what you're thinking, <em>"weeb and a geek, pick a struggle."</em> Well I also love to talk code or just about the industry in general, so feel free to share some of your work with me or contact me. I'll leave some links down <a href='#links'>below.</a></p>

            <h3>My Goals</h3>
                <p>Hopefully, if I'm doing this whole school thing right, I'll be a full-stack web developer one day. To be honest, I <em>kindaaaaaa</em> might like front-end a bit more, but mama always said if you're going to dive in, go both feet. Lately, I've just been working to try to develop my own portfolio just to show off what I'm capable of. The big project I'm working on right now is my own website, but I've got other some other side projects going on too. My plan is to start with front-end and secture a job or internship in the upcoming months that allows me to make money while also working on my craft. Hopefully, it'll also expose me to some back-end frameworks that i can use to start learning.</p>
